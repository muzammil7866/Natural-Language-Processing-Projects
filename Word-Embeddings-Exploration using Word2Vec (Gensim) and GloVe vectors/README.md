## Projects

### 1. Word Embeddings Exploration
- **File**: `Word-Embeddings-Exploration.ipynb`
- **Description**: An introductory exploration of word embeddings (Word2Vec) using the `gensim` library.
- **Key Features**:
    - Loading pre-trained GloVe vectors (trained on Twitter data).
    - Visualizing numerical representations of words.
    - Performing vector arithmetic (e.g., combining concepts like "king" and "queen").
    - Finding similar words based on vector cosine similarity.
- **Dependencies**: `gensim`, `numpy`
